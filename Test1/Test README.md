# Jira – Agile Project Coordination & UAT Tracking
## Overview

This section demonstrates how Jira was used to support Agile project coordination, sprint execution, UAT tracking, and defect management for a simulated SaaS feature delivery project.
The setup reflects real-world PMO and delivery support responsibilities rather than development-focused Jira usage.

## Project Context

Project Type: Agile SaaS Feature Delivery (Simulation)

Methodology: Scrum

Role Simulated: Project Coordinator / PMO Support / BA–UAT Support

Sprint Cadence: 2-week sprint

Tools Used: Jira (Board, Backlog, Sprint, Defects)

## Jira Configuration
### Work Types Used

Feature – High-level delivery initiatives (e.g., SaaS Feature Delivery – Sprint Coordination)

Task – Execution-level coordination and reporting activities

Bug – UAT defects identified during testing

This setup mirrors how PMO and BA teams typically work alongside development teams.

## Workflow Statuses

The Jira board was configured with the following workflow stages:

To Do – Planned but not started

In Progress – Actively being worked on

In Review / Testing – Under validation or UAT

Done – Completed and verified

This allowed clear visibility into sprint progress and delivery health.

## Key Activities Demonstrated
### Sprint Coordination

Created and tracked sprint-level coordination tasks

Monitored task movement across workflow stages

Ensured alignment between development, QA, and business teams

### PMO & Reporting Support

Jira tasks aligned with weekly status reporting activities

Used labels for categorization (e.g., sprint-tracking, status-reporting)

Maintained traceability between sprint tasks and reporting artifacts

### UAT & Defect Tracking

Logged UAT defects as Bug work items

Captured defect summary, status, and resolution

Tracked defects through completion to support release readiness

## Sample Work Items

Examples of work tracked in Jira include:

Sprint coordination for SaaS feature delivery

Tracking sprint tasks and cross-team dependencies

Supporting UAT testing and defect tracking

Preparing weekly project status reports

Documenting MoM and action items

## Outcomes & Learnings

Improved visibility into sprint execution and delivery progress

Centralized tracking of tasks and UAT defects

Demonstrated hands-on understanding of Jira from a PMO / coordination perspective

Strengthened alignment between reporting, delivery, and testing activities

## Relevance to PMO / Project Coordinator Role

This Jira setup showcases:

Practical sprint coordination experience

Understanding of Agile ceremonies and workflows

Exposure to UAT and defect lifecycle management

Strong alignment with PMO reporting and governance needs

## Artifacts Linked

Weekly Status Report (Excel)

RAID Log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)

These artifacts were aligned with Jira tracking to simulate real-world delivery reporting.

## 📌 Note

This Jira project is a structured simulation created to demonstrate hands-on delivery coordination skills and tool proficiency commonly expected in PMO, Project Coordinator, and Business Analyst roles.
