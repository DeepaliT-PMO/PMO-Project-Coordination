# Project 3: CRM Delivery & Reporting Dashboard – SaaS Platform (PMO Case Study)

## 📌 Project Snapshot
- **Domain:** SaaS / CRM / B2B  
- **Project Type:** PMO Delivery Case Study  
- **Role:** Project Coordinator / PMO Support  
- **Nature:** Simulated delivery case study  
- **Status:** In Progress

## ❗ Problem Statement
As SaaS organizations scale, CRM systems become central to managing customer onboarding,
internal workflows, and ongoing service delivery. However, delivery teams often lack
clear visibility into work allocation, resource utilization, and delivery progress
across CRM-related activities.

From a PMO perspective, the absence of structured reporting and allocation tracking
results in:
- Uneven workload distribution across teams
- Limited visibility into workforce utilization (WFM)
- Delays in identifying delivery risks and dependencies
- Inconsistent status reporting to stakeholders
- Reactive decision-making due to lack of consolidated delivery data

This creates challenges for delivery planning, prioritization, and stakeholder communication.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to establish a **structured PMO delivery support framework**
for CRM-related initiatives within a SaaS platform by improving visibility into:

- Resource allocation and workload distribution
- Workforce utilization and capacity constraints
- Delivery progress, risks, and dependencies
- Effort tracking to support budget and cost visibility at a PMO level
- Management-ready reporting for informed decision-making

The focus is on **delivery coordination and reporting**, not CRM system configuration
or ownership.

## 👩‍💼 My Contribution & Approach
I approached this project from a **Project Coordinator and PMO support perspective**,
focusing on delivery visibility, reporting discipline, and governance.

My contributions included:
- Coordinating CRM delivery activities across onboarding, support, and internal teams  
- Defining and maintaining a sprint-wise Resource Allocation Matrix  
- Supporting workforce utilization (WFM) tracking through planned vs actual effort  
- Tracking delivery progress, dependencies, and risks for PMO reporting  
- Preparing structured delivery status reports for stakeholder communication  
- Supporting effort tracking to enable delivery cost and budget visibility  

Throughout the project, emphasis was placed on clarity, consistency, and
management-ready reporting rather than tool-heavy automation.

## 📄 Key Deliverables
- CRM delivery workflow overview  
- Resource Allocation Matrix (sprint-wise)  
- Workforce utilization (WFM) tracking view  
- Delivery status reports highlighting progress, risks, and dependencies  
- Effort tracking to support PMO-level budget visibility  
- Consolidated delivery dashboard for stakeholder reporting  

---

## 📊 Sample Reports & Dashboards
The following reporting artifacts were created to support delivery visibility:

- **Resource Allocation Matrix** showing workload distribution and utilization status  
- **Workforce Utilization View** highlighting planned vs actual effort  
- **Delivery Status Report** summarizing progress, risks, and dependencies  
- **Management Dashboard** providing a consolidated view of delivery health  

> Note: Sample reports are created using Excel-based PMO artifacts to reflect
> realistic delivery environments.

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Outcomes
This case study strengthened my understanding of how structured PMO reporting and
resource visibility support effective CRM delivery in SaaS environments.

Key outcomes included:
- Practical exposure to resource allocation and utilization tracking  
- Improved understanding of WFM concepts in delivery contexts  
- Better awareness of how effort tracking supports budget discussions  
- Enhanced ability to identify delivery risks and capacity constraints early  
- Experience preparing concise, management-ready delivery reports

📎 **Note:**  
This is a simulated PMO delivery case study created to demonstrate delivery coordination,
reporting, and workforce visibility skills relevant to Project Coordinator,
PMO Analyst, and Delivery Analyst roles.
