## ❗ Problem Statement
Professionals and small businesses often rely on traditional paper business cards or fragmented digital tools, making contact sharing, profile updates, and follow-ups inefficient.

Existing solutions lack a centralized, scalable platform that allows users to create, update, and share digital business profiles seamlessly across devices while providing visibility into usage and engagement.

From a business perspective, this leads to:
- Poor user experience during networking
- Difficulty maintaining updated contact information
- Limited engagement and usage visibility
- Inefficient onboarding and profile management

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project was to define clear, actionable product requirements for a SaaS-based NFC Digital Business Card Platform that enables users to create, manage, and share digital business profiles efficiently.

Key goals included:
- Translating business needs into structured PRD documentation
- Defining user roles, core features, and success criteria
- Creating user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Identifying assumptions, dependencies, and risks early
- Ensuring stakeholder alignment before development initiation
